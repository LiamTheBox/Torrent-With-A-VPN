          <h1 class="content-header-xxl">What is Piracy?</h1>
          <p class="content-paragraph">In the digital world, it is "the practice of downloading or sharing copyrighted content without permission". Popular types of media including movies, music, software, video games and audiobooks are shared and downloaded every day.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="topic-section">
          <h1 class="content-header-xxl">Is Piracy legal?</h1>
          <p class="content-paragraph">No. According to the FBI, piracy is "punishable by up to 5 years in federal prison and a fine of $250,000". But lets be honest. No one really cares expect the companies that own the rights to their creatives works.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="topic-section">
          <h1 class="content-header-xxl">Is Piracy morally correct?</h1>
          <p class="content-paragraph">Depends. Consumers do this to get media for free or keep it forever, often encouraged after a business makes bad practices that only affect consumers or when a service is a monopoly that doesn't care about its consumers at all.</p>

          <h1 class="content-header-xxl">What is torrenting?</h1>
          <p class="content-paragraph">Torrenting is The act of downloading and sharing files through the BitTorrent protocol. The files in a torrent can be downloaded through a torrent file or magnet link for the torrent client to locate and downloand the files from users who are sharing them.</p>

        <div class="topic-section">
          <h1 class="content-header-xxl">What is a torrent client?</h1>
          <p class="content-paragraph">A torrent client is a software used to downloand and distribute content by using the BitTorrent protocol, the most efficient peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing protocol. This method of downloanding and sharing files is very effective, as they are shared with other people's computers and smartphones, and cannot be shut down by governments and copyright holders unless all devices sharing the files are powered off. In which case, people can just make another torrent of the same files and repeat the cycle.</p>
          <img class="image" src="media/images/torrent-client.jpg">
          <p class="content-paragraph-center">qBittorrent is an open-source BitTorrent client that is lightweight and simple.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="topic-section">
          <h1 class="content-header-xxl">Is torrenting legal?</h1>
          <p class="content-paragraph">Yes, you can use your torrent client to downloand and share files that are not protected by copyright law or are not illegal or malicious. Many open-source projects take advantage of this to distribute their software without the need to pay for a server and instead ask the community to share it.</p>

          <h1 class="content-header-xxl">Is torrenting safe?</h1>
          <p class="content-paragraph">Downloading and sharing files are safe if you never open them, but you need to be very careful about the files that you open. It's true that "non-executables cannot contain malware because they are not executables, so opening music and video files are safe", but this is WRONG! Here's why you should always analyse your files before opening them.</p>

        <div class="topic-section">
          <h1 class="content-header-xxl">What is a VPN?</h1><br>
          <p class="content-paragraph">short for "Virtual Private Network". VPN is a service and software that hides your IP address and makes you virtually untraceable from your Internet Service Provider (ISP), Goverment and Copyright Trolls. This is because all
            actions and connections are made in the VPN and are encrypted from your main connection.</p>

          <p class="content-paragraph">Yes! VPNs have always been used by corporations and businesses for data protection, secure remote access, secure communication and etc.</p>

          <h1 class="content-header-xxl">Can I "pirate" or use a free VPN?</h1>

          <p class="content-paragraph">Pirating a VPN is idiotic, you can install all VPN software available, but you won't have access to the VPN servers, which means you can't connect to a VPN until you pay real money. Using free VPNs is being delusional, as those do keep logs of your activity and you will still get in trouble with your ISP while downloading or sharing torrents.

          <h1 class="content-header-xxl">What if I don't use a VPN?</h1>
          <p class="content-paragraph"> The copyright holder or copyright troll gets your IP address while you were torrenting (whether you were a seed or peer) and get in contact with your ISP and you receive a letter telling you to stop you torrent activity or get a fine.</p>

          <p class="content-paragraph">"You'll be fine. The DMCA complaint issuer doesn't know who you are (unless you responded - don't ever respond). Only your ISP has connected the IP to you from their records. ToS differs between providers, but they usually will give you a 3-strikes buffer as they want to keep you as a customer (you give them money after all). Even at that, its uncommon to be fined as a customer so long as you space out your DMCA complaints so you aren't getting 3 in one year."

          <img class="image" src="media/images/germany-flg.webp">

          <p class="content-paragraph">"If you are in Germany, nothing of the first paragraph applies. The lawyers have contacted the ISP, who gave them your details. This happens on the first infraction.

            The letter you get is including a C&D together with the lawyer invoice of €2000, the maximum allowed by law. You can try to ignore it or fight it, but with limited success. If they are thin in resources, it might happen that the statute of limitations' time runs out (2 years). You'll still get threatening letters from the lawyers in the meantime. This is automated, no manpower needed. If they drag you into court, they do it just before the statute of limitations comes into effect.
            
            Also, if they want to make an example, they'll do it. If they see that you have shitload of torrents on iknowwhatyoudownload.com, they are probably trying to punish you. Lesson: Never torrent without a properly protected VPN."</p><br><br>
          
          <h1 class="content-header-xl">Too long; Didn't read</h1>

          <p class="content-paragraph">TLDR: Never torrent without a VPN, or else you get your internet shutdown or a fine. You either pay for a fine, a lawyer or a VPN. VPNs are cheap! Don't act smart using public wifi.</p>

        <h1 class="content-header-xxl-center">How To Find Movies From Torrents</h1><br>

        <p class="content-paragraph-center">Let's assume we are downloading a 2-hour movie. Searching on torrent sites, we will find:</p>

        <ul class="content-paragraph">
          <li>Bad Quality: HD/HQ-CAMRip or HDTS or HDTC (Common after release)</li>
          <li>Good quality HD: DVDRip - 4.7GB Max (Common)</li>
          <li>Better quality HD: WEBRip  (Most common)</li>
          <li>Best quality HD: BluRay - 25GB to 128GB (Less common)</li>
        </ul><br>

        <p class="content-paragraph-center">Codec is the software that compresses your video so it can be stored and played back.</p>

        <ul class="content-paragraph">
          <li>H.264/AVC (Advanced Video Encoding): Great compression codec.</li>
          <li>H.265/HEVC (high efficiency video coding): More demanding but more quality.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="content-paragraph">Remember this. The higher the bitrate, the better the quality and the higher file size, YTS is often looked down upon because of their low quality rips.</p>
