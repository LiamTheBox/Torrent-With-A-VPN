          <p class="content-paragraph">A torrent client is software used to dowloand and distribute content by using the bitorrent protocol, the most efficient peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing protocol. This type of dowloading and sharing files is very effective, as they are shared with other peoples computers and smartphones, and cannot be shutdown by and copyright holders, unless all devices sharing the files are powered off.</p>

        <div class="topic-section">
          <h1 class="content-header-xxl">What is a VPN?</h1><br>
          <p class="content-paragraph">short for "Virtual Private Network", is a service and software that hides your IP address and makes you virtually untraceable from your Internet Service Provider (ISP), Goverment and Copyright Trolls. This is because all
            actions and connections are made in the VPN and are encrypted from your house or Cell Tower, So nobody expect your VPN provider can see what you are doing.</p>

          <img class="image" src="media/images/vpn-diagram.png">

          <p class="content-paragraph"><strong>Most VPN providers do not keep logs</strong> for the purpose of the service, even if 3rd parties requested customer data, they most likely won't be able to find anything that leads to your IP address of origin.</p>
        </div>
          
        <div class="topic-section">
          <h1 class="content-header-xxl">Are VPNs Legal and Safe?</h1>

          <p class="content-paragraph">Yes they are! VPNs have always been used by corporations and businesses for data protection, secure remote access secure communication and etc.</p>

        <div class="topic-section">
          <h1 class="content-header-xxl">Can I "pirate" or use a free VPN?</h1>

          <p class="content-paragraph">Pirating a VPN is iditotic, you can install all VPN software you want but won't have access to the VPN servers, which means you can't connect to a VPN until you pay. Also, using free VPNs is being delusional, as you will still get in trouble with your ISP.

          <p class="content-paragraph"> The copyright troll gets your IP address while you were torrenting (Seeding & Peering) and get in contact with your ISP and you receive a DMCA letter telling you to stop torrenting, sometimes it can go as far as getting theatened to pay a "fine" that doesn't exist and a lawsuit against you
            after paying for the fine or admiting guilt (You should probably never do this)</p><br>
          
          <p class="content-paragraph">[For most 1st world countries] According to Reddit user <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/VPNTorrents/comments/pc0zen/what_happens_if_i_get_a_second_dmca_complaint/hagi55b/" target="_blank">u/simplex0991</a>:</p>

          <p class="content-paragraph">"You'll be fine. The DMCA complaint issuer doesn't know who you are (unless you responded - don't ever respond). Only your ISP has connected the IP to you from their records. ToS differs between providers, but they usually will give you a 3-strikes buffer as they want to keep you as a customer (you give them money after all). Even at that, its uncommon to be fired as a customer so long as you space out your DMCA complaints so you aren't getting 3 in one year."

          <p class="content-paragraph">[For Germans] According to Reddit user <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/VPNTorrents/comments/pc0zen/what_happens_if_i_get_a_second_dmca_complaint/hx1teyd/" target="_blank">u/spyfigure</a>:</p>

          <p class="content-paragraph">"If you are in Germany, nothing of the first paragraph applies. The lawyers have contacted the ISP, who gave them your details. This happens on the first infraction.

            The letter you get is including a C&D together with the lawyer invoice of €2000, the maximum allowed by law. You can try to ignore it or fight it, but with limited success. If they are thin in resources, it might happen that the statute of limitions' time runs out (2 years). You'll still get threatening letters from the lawyers in the meantime. This is automated, no manpower needed. If they drag you into court, they do it just before the statute of limitations comes into effect.
            
            Also, if they want to make an example, they'll do it. If they see that you have shitload of torrents on iknowwhatyoudownload.com, they are probably trying to punish you. Lesson: Never torrent without a properly protected VPN."</p>
