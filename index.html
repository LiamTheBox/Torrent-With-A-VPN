        <div class="topic-section">
          <h1 class="content-header-xxl">What is Piracy?</h1>
          <p class="content-paragraph">In the digital world, it is "the practice of downloading or sharing copyrighted content without permission". Popular types of media including movies, music, software, video games and audiobooks are shared and downloaded every day.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="topic-section">
          <h1 class="content-header-xxl">Is Piracy legal?</h1>
          <p class="content-paragraph">No. According to the FBI, piracy is "punishable by up to 5 years in federal prison and a fine of $250,000". But let's be honest. No one cares except the companies that own the rights to the content.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="topic-section">
          <h1 class="content-header-xxl">Is Piracy morally correct?</h1>
          <p class="content-paragraph">Depends. Consumers do this to get content for free or keep it forever, often encouraged after a business makes bad business practices that only affect consumers or when a service is a monopoly that doesn't care about its consumers at all.</p>

          <ul class="content-paragraph">
            <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/10xd7rq/netflix_rolled_out_their_bullshit_in_canada/" target="_blank">Netflix hates password sharing now</a>. Netflix has reduced piracy because customers could watch anything in a convenient service. Now they are losing subscribers by making it more expensive for families.</li><br>

        <div class="topic-section">
          <h1 class="content-header-xxl">What is torrenting?</h1>
          <p class="content-paragraph">Torrenting is the act of downloading and sharing files through the BitTorrent protocol. The files in a torrent can be downloaded through a torrent file or magnet link for the torrent client to locate and download the files from users who are sharing them.</p>

        <div class="topic-section">
          <h1 class="content-header-xxl">What is a torrent client?</h1>
          <p class="content-paragraph">A torrent client is a software used to download and distribute content by using the BitTorrent protocol. This method of downloading and sharing files is very effective, as they are shared with other people's computers and smartphones, and cannot be shut down by governments and copyright holders unless all devices sharing the files are powered off. Although other people can just make another torrent of the same files and repeat the cycle.</p>
          <img class="image" src="media/images/torrent-client.jpg">
          <p class="content-paragraph-center">qBittorrent is an open-source BitTorrent client that is lightweight and simple.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="topic-section">
          <h1 class="content-header-xxl">Is torrenting legal?</h1>
          <p class="content-paragraph">Yes, you can use your torrent client to download and share files that are not protected by copyright law or are not illegal. Many open-source projects take advantage of this to distribute their software without the need to pay for a server and instead ask the community to share it.</p>
          <img class="image" src="media/images/Linux-mint-download.png">
          <p class="content-paragraph-center">Linux Mint is an open-source operating system that is free as in freedom or libre.</p>

        <div class="topic-section">
          <h1 class="content-header-xxl">Is torrenting safe?</h1>
          <p class="content-paragraph">Downloading and sharing files are safe if you never open them, but you need to be very careful about the files that you open. It's true that "non-executables cannot contain malware because they are not executables", but this is WRONG! Here's why you should always analyse your files before opening them.</p>

        <div class="topic-section">
          <h1 class="content-header-xxl">What is a VPN?</h1><br>
          <p class="content-paragraph">short for "Virtual Private Network". VPN is a service and software that hides your IP address and makes you virtually untraceable from your Internet Service Provider (ISP), goverment and Copyright Trolls. This is because all
            actions and connections are made in the VPN and are encrypted from your main connection.</p>

          <p class="content-paragraph"><strong>Most VPN providers say they do not keep logs</strong>, it is up to you to decide if you can trust them while using their service.</p>

          <h1 class="content-header-xxl">Are VPNs legal and safe?</h1>

          <p class="content-paragraph">Yes! VPNs have always been used by corporations and businesses for data protection, secure remote access, secure communication, etc.</p>

        <div class="topic-section">
          <h1 class="content-header-xxl">Can I "pirate" or use a free VPN?</h1>

          <p class="content-paragraph">Pirating a VPN is idiotic, you can install all VPN software available, but you won't have access to the VPN servers, which means you can't connect to a VPN until you pay real money. Using free VPNs is delusional, as those do keep logs of your activity and you will still get in trouble with your ISP while downloading or sharing torrents.

        </div>

          <h1 class="content-header-xxl">What if I don't use a VPN?</h1>
          <p class="content-paragraph"> The copyright holder or copyright troll gets your IP address while you were torrenting (whether you were a seed or peer) and gets in contact with your ISP and you receive a letter telling you to stop your torrent activity or get a fine.</p>

          <img class="image" src="media/images/america-flag.jpeg">

          <p class="content-paragraph">"You'll be fine. The DMCA complaint issuer doesn't know who you are (unless you responded - don't ever respond). Only your ISP has connected the IP to you from their records. ToS differs between providers, but they usually will give you a 3-strikes buffer as they want to keep you as a customer (you give them money after all). Even at that, it's uncommon to be fined as a customer so long as you space out your DMCA complaints so you aren't getting 3 in one year."

          <img class="image" src="media/images/germany-flg.webp">

          <p class="content-paragraph">"If you are in Germany, nothing of the first paragraph applies. The lawyers have contacted the ISP, who gave them your details. This happens on the first infraction.

            The letter you get is including a C&D together with the lawyer invoice of €2000, the maximum allowed by law. You can try to ignore it or fight it, but with limited success. If they are thin in resources, the statute of limitations time could run out (2 years). You'll still get threatening letters from the lawyers in the meantime. This is automated, and no manpower is needed. If they drag you into court, they do it just before the statute of limitations comes into effect.
            
            Also, if they want to make an example, they'll do it. If they see that you have a shitload of torrents on iknowwhatyoudownload.com, they are probably trying to punish you. Lesson: Never torrent without a properly protected VPN."</p><br><br>
          
          <h1 class="content-header-xl">Too long; Didn't read</h1>

          <p class="content-paragraph">TLDR: Never torrent without a VPN, or else you get your internet shut down or a fine or a lawsuit. You either pay for a fine, a lawyer or a VPN. VPNs are cheap! Don't act smart using public wifi.</p>

        <h1 class="content-header-xxl-center">How To Find Movies From Torrents</h1><br>

        <p class="content-paragraph-center">Let's assume we are downloading a 2-hour movie. Searching on torrent sites, we will find:</p>

        <ul class="content-paragraph">
          <li>Bad Quality: HD/HQ-CAMRip or HDTS or HDTC (Common after release)</li>
          <li>Good quality HD: DVDRip - 4.7GB Max (Common)</li>
          <li>Better quality HD: WEBRip  (Most common)</li>
          <li>Best quality HD: BluRay - 25GB to 128GB (Less common)</li>
        </ul><br>

        <p class="content-paragraph">Codec is the software that compresses your video to store and play it</p>

        <ul class="content-paragraph">
          <li>H.264/AVC (Advanced Video Encoding): Great compression codec.</li>
          <li>H.265/HEVC (high-efficiency video coding): More demanding but more quality.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="content-paragraph">Remember this. A higher bitrate is better quality and a higher file size.</p><br>
