        <div class="topic-section">
          <h1 class="content-header-xxl">What is Piracy?</h1>
          <p class="content-paragraph">In the digital world, it is "the practice of downloading or distributing copyrighted content without permission". Popular types of media including movies, music, software, video games and audiobooks are uploaded and downloaded every day.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="topic-section">
          <h1 class="content-header-xxl">Is Piracy legal?</h1>
          <p class="content-paragraph">No. According to the FBI, piracy is "punishable by up to 5 years in federal prison and a fine of $250,000".</p>
        </div>

        <div class="topic-section">
          <h1 class="content-header-xxl">Is Piracy morally correct?</h1>
          <p class="content-paragraph">Depends on the company or business. It is a great punishment to fight against bad business practices that only affect consumers or when a service is a monopoly that doesn't care about its consumers at all.</p>

          <ul class="content-paragraph">
            <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/10xd7rq/netflix_rolled_out_their_bullshit_in_canada/" target="_blank">Netflix hates password sharing now</a>. Netflix has reduced piracy because of their convenient service, now they are losing subscribers.</li><br>

        <div class="topic-section">
          <h1 class="content-header-xxl">What is torrenting?</h1>
          <p class="content-paragraph">Torrenting is The act of downloading and sharing files through the BiTorrent protocol. A torrent file or magnet link contains the information that is needed for the torrent client to locate and downloand the files from the users who are sharing them.</p>
          <img class="image" src="media/images/torrent-network.jpg">
        </div>

        <div class="topic-section">
          <h1 class="content-header-xxl">What is a torrent client?</h1>
          <p class="content-paragraph">A torrent client is a software used to downloand and distribute content by using the BiTorrent protocol, the most efficient peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing protocol. This type of downloanding and sharing files is very effective, as they are shared with other people's computers and smartphones, and cannot be shut down by governments and copyright holders unless all devices sharing the files are powered off.</p>
          <img class="image" src="media/images/torrent-client.jpg">
          <p class="content-paragraph-center">qBittorrent is an open-source BiTorrent client that is lightweight and simple.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="topic-section">
          <h1 class="content-header-xxl">Is torrenting legal?</h1>
          <p class="content-paragraph">Yes, you can use your torrent client to downloand and share files that are not protected by copyright law or are not illegal or malicious. Many open-source projects take advantage of this to distribute their software without the need to pay for a server and instead ask the community to share it.</p>

          <h1 class="content-header-xxl">Is torrenting safe?</h1>
          <p class="content-paragraph">Downloading and sharing files are safe if you never open them, but you need to be very careful about the files that you open. It's true that "non-executables cannot contain malware because they are not executables, so opening music and video files are safe", but this is WRONG! Here's why people are hacked with PDF files.</p>

        <div class="topic-section">
          <h1 class="content-header-xxl">What is a VPN?</h1><br>
          <p class="content-paragraph">short for "Virtual Private Network", is a service and software that hides your IP address and makes you virtually untraceable from your Internet Service Provider (ISP), Goverment and Copyright Trolls. This is because all
            actions and connections are made in the VPN and are encrypted from your house or Cell Tower, So nobody expects your VPN provider can see what you are doing.</p>

          <img class="image" src="media/images/vpn-diagram.png">

          <p class="content-paragraph"><strong>Most VPN providers say they do not keep logs</strong>, it is up to you to decide if you can trust them while downloading or sharing torrents.</p>

          <h1 class="content-header-xxl">Can I "pirate" or use a free VPN?</h1>

          <p class="content-paragraph">Pirating a VPN is idiotic, you can install all VPN software available, but you won't have access to the VPN servers, which means you can't connect to a VPN until you pay. Also, using free VPNs is being delusional, as those do keep all logs and you will still get in trouble with your ISP.

          <p class="content-paragraph">"You'll be fine. The DMCA complaint issuer doesn't know who you are (unless you responded - don't ever respond). Only your ISP has connected the IP to you from their records. ToS differs between providers, but they usually will give you a 3-strikes buffer as they want to keep you as a customer (you give them money after all). Even at that, its uncommon to be fired as a customer so long as you space out your DMCA complaints so you aren't getting 3 in one year."

          <p class="content-paragraph">"If you are in Germany, nothing of the first paragraph applies. The lawyers have contacted the ISP, who gave them your details. This happens on the first infraction.

            The letter you get is including a C&D together with the lawyer invoice of €2000, the maximum allowed by law. You can try to ignore it or fight it, but with limited success. If they are thin in resources, it might happen that the statute of limitations' time runs out (2 years). You'll still get threatening letters from the lawyers in the meantime. This is automated, no manpower needed. If they drag you into court, they do it just before the statute of limitations comes into effect.
            
            Also, if they want to make an example, they'll do it. If they see that you have shitload of torrents on iknowwhatyoudownload.com, they are probably trying to punish you. Lesson: Never torrent without a properly protected VPN."</p>

            <li>Torrent client opens a setup download window. Just click “OK” for now, as you are not dowloading a file that should go inside a “Torrents” or “qBittorrent” folder</li>
            <li>Go back to your browser and wait 10 seconds</li>
            <li>Check your "Torrent Address" is the same as"Your IP Addresses", at least one
